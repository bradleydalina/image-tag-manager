== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What will happen when I remove this plugin? =

This plugin has an options, the `data_saving` which can be found in the under > Media> Image Tag manager > plugin settings.

* The **Data Saving** option applies on before saving of any post type e.g( pages, post ) so the the attributes will be saved along with the content in the database, and when you remove this plugin the (title) attribute will remain. However Gutenberg content editor does not recognized title as a valid attribute in an image tag.
* While setting this option to false, it only filters the content before it renders the page using wordpress filter hooks. So this does not affects your database or modify the original content of your post. But when you remove this plugin the title attributes will no longer take effect unless you do it manually or use another plugin.

= Does it applies in * all images in the website? =

Yes! It captures all images that can be scanned within the page. So your logo's, footer badges can also have the alt's and title attributes. Please also note that there are some filters which are not applicable globally like adding the category of the post, it is only applicable in the post content images.

= What happens to the image `old or original` attributes? =

This plugin has an override option if you want to override the old/original/current alt's and title attributes of the image. If set to false the plugin will skip the image will has already alt and title attributes.
